Yomichan frequency dictionaries I created. They can be imported directly into yomichan (unless otherwise noted).

The full list of novels/volumes used can be found in the identically named text file.

PHCore - while not purely based on isekai light novels, they do make up the majority

PHFull - based on a whole bunch of novels, which would mean it is closer to an all-encompoassing corpus frequency. Note: You need to unpack the 7z file via 7zip/winrar etc before you can import the dictionary.
